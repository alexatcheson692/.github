Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an experienced software developer with a passion for creating robust and scalable applications. My expertise lies primarily in JavaScript, but I am also proficient in Python, Ruby, and Java. I have extensive experience working with frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Django, allowing me to build seamless, full-stack web applications.

Over the years, I have honed my skills in software development methodologies like Agile and Scrum, contributing to various team projects that emphasize collaboration and continuous integration. My interest in DevOps practices has led me to work with tools such as Docker and Kubernetes, which help in automating deployment processes and managing scalable applications.

I enjoy solving complex problems and strive to write clean, efficient code. My passion for learning drives me to stay updated with the latest industry trends, and I regularly contribute to open-source projects to give back to the community.

Here are some of my pinned repositories that reflect my journey and skills:

- [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/alexatcheson692/portfolio-website): My personal portfolio that exhibits my projects and skills, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
